# PoolCar

Moved to this repository because using SwiftUI required making a new project.

# Install Instructions:
* Checkout repo with https. 
* If cocoapods is not installed, run sudo gem install cocoapods.
* Then run pod install. 

The repo should then be ready to run.

ONLY OPEN .xcworkspace file NOT .xcodeproj
